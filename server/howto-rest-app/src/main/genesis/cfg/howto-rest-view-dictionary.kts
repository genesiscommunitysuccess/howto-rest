/**
 * This file defines the views for this application. Views provide a way to
 * create a view across entities which are more friendly, for example joining a
 * trade to an instrument to provide the details of the instrument for
 * presentation next to the trade.
 *
 * Views also allow for the addition of dynamic columns calculated in real time.
 *
 * Views may be used across the system including as inputs to consolidators,
 * expose as APIs in the request response server as snapshots of data or as real
 * time ticking APIs in the data server.

 * Full documentation on views may be found here >> https://docs.genesis.global/docs/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#views
